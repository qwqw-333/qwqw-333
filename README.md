## 👋 Hi, I’m Andrii — a DevOps Engineer & Infrastructure Architect

I design, build, and lead secure infrastructure systems that scale with confidence.
With over 5 years of experience in production-grade DevOps, I specialize in CI/CD automation, cloud-native architecture, and fault-tolerant networks using BGP, OSPF, and VPN overlays.

I’ve led cross-functional teams in delivering highly available platforms across cloud and on-prem environments, combining performance, security, and cost-efficiency.
Currently open to remote opportunities in DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, or Infrastructure Architecture.
